Suppose we are interested in studying how much chocolate is consumed by Coursera students, measured in grams per week. 
After surveying 500 students, we calculate an average of 175 grams per week with a standard deviation of 195 grams per week. 
Which of the following is not necessarily true?

A point estimate for the population standard deviation is 195.
x¯=175,s=195
A histogram of the samples will be skewed to the right.
μ=175, σ=195
